# Recipe_Finder

This project aims to find the recipe hidden in a recipe website since the writer often talks about their life stories in the beginning that no one cares about.

## Project revival
Originally this project was put on hiatus. Coming back, I would like to implement some real machine-learning algorithms.
This revision will be using transferred learning. I could use RNNs or CNNs but that would take too much computational power and, LLM exists already...

### Machine learning section
- [] [Pick model]
- [] [Create new structured classification data]
- [] [Data preprocessing]
- [] [Tune model]
